# SMART MONIROTRING AND CONTROL SYSTEM

## Introduction
Theme content is only used in the following scope:
- The problem is that our knowledge of IoT system design in the bedroom with DHT11 and water level is only designed at the model level and has not been applied in practice.
- The smart irrigation system at this project allows you to observe the temperature, humidity, water level.

The system hardware consists of the following components:
-	Test board to connect the pins of components
-	1 ESP32 MCU to read and write values and connect Google Firebase via WiFi
-	1 Water level sensor measures water value
-	1 DHT11 sensor reads the temperature and humidity of the environment
-	1 LED for display
-	1 buzzer
-	1 Relay DC 5V
-	1 DC 5V Fan
